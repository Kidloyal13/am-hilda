          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>I am Hilda Mbiyu. I am 20 years old. I study at the California university currenly pursuing a Bachelor degree in Photograpy. The world of art has been my passon since I was very little. My elder brother is a photographer, and my source of insipiration. I like to photograph anyone before they know what their best angles are. I am not interested in shooting nwe things,I am interested in shooting something new. The greastest photographs are motivated by human feelings. When people say what equipment I use, I say my eyes. As<b><u>Marc Riboud</u></b> says<b> "Taking pictures is savoring life intensely, every hundreth of a second".</b> i use that saying to motivate me daily. What i like about Photograpy is that they capture a moment thats gone forever, imposible to reproduce.The pictures are there, and you just take them.For me, documentary Photograpy has always come with great responisibilities. Not just to tell the story honestly and empathy, but also to make sure th right people hear it. When you photograph somebody who is in pain or discomfort, they trust you to make sure the images will act as their advocate </p>
